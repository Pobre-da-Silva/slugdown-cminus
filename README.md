# Slugdown C-
## Overview
**Slugdown C-** is the Slugdown library implemented in C++.

If you want to see the original JavaScript version
go to <https://github.com/Pobre-da-Silva/slugdown>.

## Building
This project uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/)
as a building configuration tool to generate
project files for all platforms.
Therefore, one should use
[Premake's documentation](https://premake.github.io/docs/)
as a guide to generating them.
After generating the project files,
the rest of the process depends on which tool is being used.

## Examples
For examples, check the `test.cpp` file included with the source code.
It shows how to use all the functions included in the library
and also serves as a test (as the name suggests) to check whether
the compiled build of the library is working.
